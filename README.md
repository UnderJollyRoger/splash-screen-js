# splash-screen-js

Easy to use CSS splash screen that is fast and 100% framework agnostic. You don't need Angular, Ember, jQuery, React, Polymer, Bootstrap, etc. It's just good old CSS3 and JavaScript...seriously. Just bolt it into an existing app, tweak it to your needs and then hit the gas.

Also included is a minimized version of the [css](css/splashscreen-min.css). It weighs in at ONLY 1.256KB! For the highest performance,
bolt the minimized CSS directly into your HTML app so that you avoid yet another HTTP request.

Many thanks to the inspiration from [@ihatetomatoes](https://ihatetomatoes.net/create-custom-preloading-screen/).
